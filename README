TicTacToe

This TicTacToe game was designed for a CS300 assignment at Portland
State University Fall 2010 with Bart Massey.

For installation instructions, please see the file INSTALL.

This is a simple 2 Player Tic Tac Toe game board. You and a friend can share a
computer mouse and take turns placing X's and O's.

When the game launches it should show a red X on the right next to an arrow.
This is the turn indicator, letting you know it's X's turn. When there are less
X's than O's, this will turn into a red O.

Above the red X you'll see two grey letters. These are how you select what to
play. When you click one, you have selected that letter. Once you have selected 
a letter you may place it in any empty space.

The game ends when X wins, O wins, or there is a draw. Another game will start
right away.

As an explicit requirement, this version of Tic Tac Toe allows and does not
penalize for playing out of turn.
