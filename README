TicTacToe

Hey here's some instructions for playing the game, since in its early stages it
can be difficult to understand exactly.

When the game launches it should show a red "X" on the right, with an arrow.
This is the turn indicator, letting you know it's X's turn. Currently this does
not correctly change for every turn, so it will probably stay X. I have seen it
switch to O on a new game, however.

Above the red "X" you'll see two grey letters. These are how you select what to
play. When you click one you have selected that letter. It's supposed to turn
blue, but that also isn't working quite yet. Once you have selected a letter you
may place it in any empty space.

The game ends when either X wins, O wins, or the board is full. And another game
will start right away.
