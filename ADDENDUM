Addendum to the Wildfire C++ Programming Style Guide

3.3 Header File Content
    The RCS $Header$ variable should be placed as the end of the block comment,
    or in a comment immediately following it:
    // $Header$

--->This is not being included as it is not required for Mercurial

    The header guard's #endif need be followed by a comment describing the
    #ifdef head guard. 
    After all, it is the last directive in the file and should obvious.

--->This mess of grammar that contradicts itself is being skipped. The latter
    point that what is being defined is obvious is true.

5.2 Identifier Style

    Identifiers are either upper caps, mixed case, or lower case. If an identifier
    is upper caps, word separation in multi-word identifiers is done with an
    underscore (for example, RUN_QUICK). If an identifier is mixed case, it starts
    with a capital, and word separation is done with caps (for example, RunQuick).
    If an identifier is lower case, words are separated by underscore (for example,
    run_quick). Preprocessor identifiers and template parameters are upper case. The
    mixed case identifiers are global variables, function names, types (including
    class names), class data members, enum members. Local variables and class member
    functions are lower case.

--->For class member functions, data members, and local variables the style above 
    requires something like "foo_bar" and this is being ignored to match the Qt 
    style of something more like "fooBar".
